# meteor-angular-socially - [Tutorial's site](http://angularjs.meteor.com/tutorial)
angular-meteor example and tutorial app.

The tutorial starts at branch 'step_00' till the last step.

The master branch is always equal to the last step.

Here is the deployed final version - http://socially-step18.meteor.com/

Please contribute to the tutorial.
Pull request the master branch to add new features or pull request specific step to improve that step.

Our goal in this tutorial is to add more steps as we go along, to cover as many use cases as possible.

Thanks @MilosStanic for writing step 18 on angular-material

An example with the `controller as` syntax can be found in [this branch](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-angular-socially/tree/step_12_controller_as_vm).

# angular-meteor University! <a href="http://angularjs.meteor.com/"><img src="http://angularjs.meteor.com/images/logo-large.png" width="60" height="60" /></a>  

The angular-meteor university is a community learning experiment, we would like to create a similar experience to the [hueniversity](https://github.com/hueniverse/hueniversity)


[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Urigo/angular-meteor](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Urigo/angular-meteor?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

The first assignments will be to rewrite the tutorial steps, and follow the latest angular-meteor API , in a more [consistent style](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).
We also hope the community will propose better solutions than the current ones.
When we will catch up with the latest steps we will create new steps.

### What am I going to learn?
You will learn how to build a full stack application using meteor and angular. It will start with the basics and move on to the more advanced topic such as users and authentication, application architecture, reactivity, mobile app, ionic, working with files, Angular Server, ES6 and more.


### What do I need to know?
You should feel comfortable writing simple functions in JavaScript, working with GitHub, using basic git commands, have a basic familiarity with mongoDB, and be able to pick up new subjects by reading tutorials and documentation.

### How advanced is this course?
We'll start from the basics and make our way to the most advanced topics. The way this course is structured, you can choose which assignments to participate in, so more experienced developers can "sit out" or help others during the basic assignments and participate when it gets to areas they are not as strong in. However, since teaching is one of the most effective ways to learn, we believe that participating early will improve the existing skills of advanced developers.
The assignment will include just enough information to get you going, but you will need to do most of the learning on your own by using the wide range of online resources available. However, the real benefit of this process will come from the code review of your Pull Request. This is where expert developers will review your work and provide you specific and actionable feedback.

### How does it work?
First, read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-angular-socially/blob/master/COC.md) !

Simple, you start by forking this repo.
Every few days a new issue will be posted with an [`assignment` label](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-angular-socially/labels/assignment)
. If you would like to participate in the assignment, try to solve it and when you are done, submit a Pull Request back to this repo to the `step_NUMBER_u` branch. Make sure your code complies with the [john papa angular style guid](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).
While you wait for the assignment to close, take a look at what others are submitting and see if you can improve your own solution (borrow ideas, add tests, write examples, update the documentation). If you see ways in which others can improve their solution, please donâ€™t hesitate to comment on their Pull Request.
Each assignment will have a final submission date. When the issue expires, one of the Pull Requests submitted will be picked and merged and published as the new tutorial step. Any follow up assignments will be based on the merged code.
Before starting the next assignment, make sure [your fork matches the current](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-angular-socially/blob/master/guides/git.md ) assignment step branch (`step_NUMBER_u`) since only one Pull Request can be accepted.

### How can I help?

There are lots of way you can help make this experiment succeed and help shape a new format for teaching development skills:
Submit Pull Requests to improve this readme, add examples, write quick tutorials on how to work with git, etc.
Add new steps to angular-meteor-socially tutorial.
Look for issues with a [help wanted label](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-angular-socially/labels/help%20wanted) and help with those.
Randomly pick submitted Pull Request and review them, offering advice and helping others improve their skills.
Submit Pull Request or open issues with proposals for [angular-meteor](https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor) 

### Anything else?
[Open an issue](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-angular-socially/issues/new), it's free.
