# Code of Conduct

Learning in plain sight can be an intimidating experience. Your code, mistakes, and community feedback are all publically displayed for everyone to see. While this is true for any open source project, course participants are here to learn and can feel a lot more vulnerable.

It is absolutely crucial that any interaction is done with respect, care, and without judgment, and that any feedback is provided gently. We want to teach and learn from each other, and for that to happen, we must treat each other with care.

This course is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any material posted to this repository or in other venues discussing it (e.g. Twitter and other online media). Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the course at the discretion of the maintainers as well as reported to GitHub for abuse.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of others, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Teachers and maintainers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, they should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the course.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of course team immediately. The list of maintainers can be found at the top of the [README document](https://github.com/hueniverse/hueniversity/blob/master/README.md).

We expect participants to follow these rules at any related social events.
